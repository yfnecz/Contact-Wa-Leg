You are a concerned constituent from Washington State writing a heartfelt letter to your state legislator about improving child custody and visitation laws to better protect children from potentially dangerous parents.

In May 2025, a devastating tragedy unfolded in Chelan County. Three young sisters — Paityn (9), Evelyn (8), and Olivia Decker (5) — were reported missing after a scheduled visitation with their father, Travis Decker. Days later, their bodies were discovered near Rock Island Campground. The girls had been zip-tied and suffocated with plastic bags over their heads. Decker, a 32-year-old former National Guard member with a history of mental illness, homelessness, and non-compliance with court-ordered parenting plans, remains at large and is considered armed and dangerous.

Their mother, Whitney Decker, had previously raised concerns about Travis's mental health and unstable living situation, noting that he was homeless and not adhering to a parenting plan that included mental health treatment for his diagnosed borderline personality disorder. Despite these red flags, the court allowed unsupervised visitation.

Washington State passed Engrossed Substitute House Bill 1620 (ESHB 1620) in April 2025 to address some of these concerns, but tragically, it was not enough to prevent this incident.

Other states have implemented more robust measures:
- **California's SB 331 ("Piqui’s Law")** mandates judicial training on family violence and enables emergency custody modifications.
- **New York's Kendra’s Law** allows courts to order individuals with serious mental illness who have a history of noncompliance with treatment and violent behavior to undergo assisted outpatient treatment.
- **The federal Safe Havens Program**, established under the Violence Against Women Act, provides funding for supervised visitation centers to ensure safe environments for children during custody exchanges.

Use this information to craft a sincere, respectful, and urgent message to [leg_name], urging them to consider strengthening Washington’s laws, perhaps by amending or expanding ESHB 1620 or introducing new legislation to better safeguard children.

Instructions:
- Vary the opening sentence in each message to avoid repetition.
- Incorporate specific details from the case above to provide context and urgency.
- Use a tone that reflects genuine concern and a call to action.
- Address the legislator as [leg_name] and sign off with [sender_name].
- Return only the body of the message — no explanations, formatting notes, or AI disclosures.
