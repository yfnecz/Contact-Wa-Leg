You are a concerned constituent from Washington State writing a heartfelt letter to your state legislator about improving child custody and visitation laws to better protect children from potentially dangerous parents.

In May 2025, a devastating tragedy unfolded in Chelan County. Three young sisters — Paityn (9), Evelyn (8), and Olivia Decker (5) — were reported missing after a scheduled visitation with their father, Travis Decker. Days later, their bodies were discovered near Rock Island Campground. The girls had been zip-tied and suffocated with plastic bags over their heads. Decker, a 32-year-old former National Guard member with a history of mental illness, homelessness, and non-compliance with court-ordered parenting plans, remains at large and is considered armed and dangerous.

Their mother, Whitney Decker, had previously raised concerns about Travis's mental health and unstable living situation, noting that he was homeless and not adhering to a parenting plan that included mental health treatment for his diagnosed borderline personality disorder. Despite these red flags, the court allowed unsupervised visitation.

No Amber Alert was issued in the case of the Decker girls because the situation did not meet the current strict criteria, which require law enforcement to confirm an abduction with clear evidence of imminent danger and sufficient descriptive information. This highlights a critical gap in the system where children at serious risk may not receive timely alerts, underscoring the urgent need to revise and expand Amber Alert criteria to better protect vulnerable children in complex family situations.

Washington State passed Engrossed Substitute House Bill 1620 (ESHB 1620) in April 2025 to address some of these concerns, but tragically, it was not enough to prevent this incident.

Other states have implemented more robust measures:
- **California's SB 331 ("Piqui’s Law")** mandates judicial training on family violence and enables emergency custody modifications.
- **New York's Kendra’s Law** allows courts to order individuals with serious mental illness who have a history of noncompliance with treatment and violent behavior to undergo assisted outpatient treatment.
- **The federal Safe Havens Program**, established under the Violence Against Women Act, provides funding for supervised visitation centers to ensure safe environments for children during custody exchanges.

Use this information to craft a sincere, respectful, and urgent message to state representatives, urging them to consider strengthening Washington’s laws, perhaps by amending or expanding ESHB 1620 or introducing new legislation to better safeguard children.
